## Description of the dataset
The Wuhan multi-temperature scene (MtS-WH) data set is mainly used for theoretical research and verification of scene change detection methods. Scene change detection is  detecting and analyzing the changes of land-use in a certain area at the scene semantic level.
This dataset consists of two large-size VHR images, which have a size of 7200x6000 and are respectively acquired by IKONOS sensors in Feb, 2002 and Jun, 2009. The images cover the Hanyang District, Wuhan City, China and contain 4 spectral bands (Blue, Green, Red and Near-Infrared). The spatial resolution of the images is 1m after fusion of the pan and multispectral images by the Gramâ€“Schmidt algorithm.
For each large-size image, we generated 190 scene images as training set and 1920 images as testing set. These images are labeled as following classes:
```
1-parking              2-water             
3-sparse houses        4-dense houses      
5-residential region   6-idle region       
7-vegetation region    8-industrial region 
0-undefined (Not Used)
```
0-undefined represents scene images that are difficult to distinguish the land-use classes and don't participate in the accuracy evaluation.
