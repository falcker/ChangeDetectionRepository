# Hyperspectral Change Detection Dataset

## Description
This dataset can be used to perform change detection techniques in multitemporal hyperspectral images.

It includes two different hyperspectral scenes from the AVIRIS sensor:
```
The Santa Barbara scene, taken on the years 2013 and 2014 with the AVIRIS sensor over the Santa Barbara region (California) whose spatial dimensions are 984 x 740 pixels and includes 224 spectral bands.

The Bay Area scene, taken on the years 2013 and 2015 with the AVIRIS sensor surrounding the city of Patterson (California) whose spatial dimensions are 600 x 500 pixels and includes 224 spectral bands.
```
