## Description
Season-varying dataset (SVCD) acquired from Google Earth, including seven season-varying image-pairs with a size of 4725 2200 pixels and four season-varying image-pairs with a size of 1900x1000 pixels. The spatial resolution of these images varies from 0.03m to 1m per pixel. The authors cropped these 11 multi-temporal image-pairs into image patchpairs with a size of 256x256 pixels. Finally, the SVCD dataset contains 10000 image-pairs for training, 3000 imagepairs for validation, and 3000 image-pairs for testing.
