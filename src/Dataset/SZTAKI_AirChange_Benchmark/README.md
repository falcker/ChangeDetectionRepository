# SZTAKI AirChange Benchmark set
<div align=center><img src="ACD.png" width="60%" height="60%"></div>

## Description
This Benchmark set contains 13 aerial image pairs of size 952x640 and resolution 1.5m/pixel and binary change masks (drawn by hand), which were used for evaluation in publications [1] and [2].
Each record constains a pair of preliminary registered input images and a mask of the 'relevant' changes. The input images are taken with 5, 7 resp. 23 years time differences. During the generation of the change mask, we have considered the following differences as relevant changes: (a) new built-up regions (b) building operations (c) planting of large group of trees (d) fresh plough-land (e) groundwork before building over. Note that the ground truth does NOT contain change classification, only binary change-no change decision for each pixel. For more information please contact Csaba Benedek.
